### ä½ å¥½~ðŸ‘‹
I'm HM,a high school student from China,who currently don't know how to codeðŸ˜‚.         
I now use github to find awsome softwares and report bugs,and sometimes give ~~(stupid?)~~ advice.            
As I am not a native English speaker,there might be mistakes in my explanation.If you spot one,please just tell me directly.
